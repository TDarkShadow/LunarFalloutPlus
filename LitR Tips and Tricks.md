# LitR Survival - Tips

Whether or not you play in Survival Mode, the core philosophy of Life in the Ruins is *Adapt To What The World Gives You*. A lot of things you took for granted in Vanilla, like near-infinite ammo or being able to get the perfect legendary weapon for your build, don't apply any more. LitR is designed to be a lite survival game, trying to hit the sweet spot where you need to care about your resources, but without the level of simulationist complexity where you need a spreadsheet to track everying, and have to check wiki-articles anytime you want to do something because there are a hundred different subsystems to learn. Playing on Survival mode adds hunger and thirst, as well as fast travel restrictions- but it does not massively decrease the player to enemy damage ratio the way it does in vanilla survival.

## Pacing
- Lunar Fallout Overhaul extends and rebalances the games progression. Early game lasts till around level 20-25, mid game lasts to around 50-60, and end game enemies cap out their scaling around level 100.
- The early game is significantly harder if you try to rush the main quest. Trying to go downtown before level 10 is asking for trouble, and don't try to go after kellog before at least level 15. Gunners, Super Mutants, and Synths are all SIGNIFICANTLY more difficult, those are fights you will need to prepare for.

## Combat: Damage, Health and Healing
- LitR is balanced for default lunar survival damage levels (1 and 1.3), but can be adjusted in the MCM to whatever you want, just make sure you've fought some synths and super mutants before tweaking (because they WILL wreck you). This is an RPG, the early game enemies are supposed to be easy.
- In LitR, the player has a lot more health, and combat should not generally feel super lethal. Horizon players should be familiar with this strategic resource based rather than tactical balance approach. The sweet spot LitR tries to hit is that you can get through most encounters without dying, but you do have to use healing resources, and you need to prepare for difficult encounters. This is specifically to fix the tactical respawn-until-you-get-it-right style gameplay vanilla survival has.
- Food can only heal you up to the segment thresholds in your health bar- if you lose an entire segment of health, you need a stimpak, a medpak, or a doctor to get it back.
- Drinks now grant AP buffs, instead of healing.

## Ammo    
- Lunar Fallout Overhaul moves Armor Piercing from the receiver to some ammunition calibers- these are designated with either AP or +P in the name. These will do a lot more damage to heavily armored enemies, so don't waste them.
- Use a melee weapon to conserve ammo on lower level enemies. Ammo is scarce, you will probably need to buy some at some point, so don't waste it.
- Commando grants the chance for extra ammo with automatics, if you want to spray bullets, you're going to need it.
- Because Ammo is scarce, don't expect to be able to use a single weapon and ignore everything else the way you can in vanilla.
- (Settle Profile only) The only ammo crafting available is through the Contraptions DLC.

## Crafting
### Armor
- There is no armor crafting at the Chemistry bench, if you want something, you have to loot it or buy it.
- Pocketed mods are disabled- if you want to increase your carry weight find a backpack- just be aware that they have a stamina penalty.

### Guns
Weapon crafting works a little differently in LitR. Some basic customization is still available, but finding the perfect base weapon is more important.
- Attachments (mags/scopes/muzzles) are swappable- just pull it off one weapon, and put it on another
- Pipe class weapons are more customizable. They have lower perk requirements and can can have their barrel/grip modified. But they deal less damage than pre-war weapons of the same caliber. 
- Recievers are crafted with Weapon Scrap that is obtained by scrapping weapons (make sure to pull off any attachments you want first)
- Weapons that have degraded will have an extra "repair" recipe available to them that allows the player to craft a replacement reciever even if they don't have the perks normally required. 

## Buying & Selling
- The economy in LitR is based primarily on trade, not on currency.
- Don't expect to accumulate caps by mindless vacumming up all the garbage you see and dragging it to a vendor. 
- Look for items with high value and low weight (e.g. Cigarette Packs are a great example of this), and use them in trade when you want to buy an expensive item.
- Vendors have significantly fewer caps, and there are no ways to increase the amount of caps they have.
- If you want caps, then you have to go find them the old fashion way: ask for a quest.
- Keep an eye out for valuable items, they're useful when you want to trade with a vendor for something expensive.
- Vendors will typically only buy items they're interested in selling. E.g. weapons vendors aren't interested in buying your chems anymore, you'll need to find a chems dealer to offload them.


## Food
- Keep your eye out for unique food items at vendors, eating them can unlock a new recipe.
- Crops have a lower harvest rate, don't expect to get something every time. If you want fruit and vegetables to cook with, your best bet is to build up a farm with enough extra production above and beyond what the settlers require that they'll leave some in the workbench for you.
- Cola and other drinks are great for a quick AP boost, but no longer heal.

## Power Armor
- Power Armor is VERY powerful. You can almost completely ignore small arms fire, but watch out for heavy weaponry and armor piercing munitions, as they deal extra damage to power armor.
- Power armor is very difficult to maintain. Repairing it is expensive.
- Power armor is for special occasions. Fusion cores are rare enough that without some way to produce or recycle them yourself, you won't be able to maintain power amor 100% of the time.
- Different power armors have different niches- the T60 is weaker than the T51 for example, but cheaper to repair.
    * Raider : Cheap, easy to repair, but low protection
    * T45 : decent protection, but eats fusion cores harder to repair
    * T51 : The gold standard PA, best resistances, but hardest to maintain
    * T60 : lower armor, better energy resist, and easier to maintain than the T51
    * X01 : Super-rare, highly experimental prototypes, not very strong without upgrading, requires finding unique schematics to upgrade, but with investment can be the best in the game.

## Hacking and Lockpicking
- As long as you have the locksmith perk of the required level, Lockpicking can be bypassed by kicking, shooting, or exploding (based on whether the lock is a door, container, or safe) with Locky Bastard.
- Hacking can be bypassed with Mentats, as long as you have the hacker perk of the required level.

## Settlements
### Choosing where to build you home base
- Don't use Sanctuary/RedRocket/Abernathy as your home base. 
    * Because these settlements are so close to eachother, fully building more than one of these up can result in performance issues if you really push the build limit. Don't use a SS2 city plan on more than 1 of them at the same time.
    * Without fast travel getting to the edge of the map is a pain, pick somewhere more central (e.g., Starlight Drivein).

### Sim Settlements
- You don't have to start the SS2 quest (build your first recruitment beacon) in sanctuary, Jake will find you at other settlements. I recommend picking somewhere more central, but it's up to you.
- The default settings for SS2 have slow build times enabled, if plots aren't building make sure that you have the required resources, but you probably just need to wait.

## True Perks Builds
- If you haven't used True Perks before, don't worry too much about specials at character creation, just put something in, and then after you get the pip boy, spend some time looking at the perks, find a few you want to try, and rebuild your specials around getting them before exiting the vault.
- There is a purchasable perk point respec called "Mindwipe" that will allow you to reset your invested perks, but it won't allow you to respec your specials.
- Because "required" perks have lower requirements, pretty much any build is viable, as long as you have a good mix of offense and defense.
- There are no "dump" specials. Putting a 1 in any special will have significant drawbacks.
- Specials can be trained past 10.
- Special training perks now have a level requirement- you can take the 1st rank at level 7, the 2nd at level 14, etc.

## Collectibles
- Magazines and Bobblehead locations are randomized, and you probably won't get all of them in a single playthrough.
- There are now 2 full sets of bobbleheads, Vault Boy and Vault Girl.

## Uniques
- Almost every single unique weapon and armor in the game has been replaced with a modded weapon, armor, or gadget, including the ones you can buy in shops. Some of them are very powerful end game items, so check them out when you're shopping. You will want to buy some of them now.
- If a mod is used as a Unique Replacer, then you will not find that weapon, armor, or item anywhere else in the game. That is what "Unique" means.

# Survival Mode
## Carry Weight
- Carry weight is heavily reduced, BUT encumbrance is now manageable
- The player can run while over-encumbered, but it drains AP. Grab a backpack for extra carry-weight, and to decrease the drain rate while encumbered. Or grab some nuka cola for the AP Regen buff.
- You still take periodic damage while over-encumbered, but you don't take any limb damage. Make sure to bring some food with you.
- The overall effect of these changes, is that encumbrance isn't much of problem outside of combat.

## Companions
- Dogmeat doesn't count as a companion for the Lone Wanderer Perk
- Companions heal themselves (assuming you've loaded the default MCM settings), and don't need to be stimpacked/repaired when they go down in combat.
- Companions can use weapons similar to their default weapon without expending ammo (they just need 1 ammo in their inventory, like settlers)

## Survival Disease
- Survival disease is completely disabled. It is a poorly implemented mechanic that distracts from the core gameplay loop of exploration.

## Camping
- While there are no camping mods included, Sofa Surfing will let you rest on any sofa or armchair.

## Survival Fast Travel
- Local Leader offers fast travel by talking to provisioners at level 2 (to their home or destination settlements).
- When upgraded to level 2, SS2's caravan plots allow fast travel to linked settlements.
- Full fast travel can be enabled in survival mode in the Unlimited Survival MCM, if walking isn't your cup of tea.

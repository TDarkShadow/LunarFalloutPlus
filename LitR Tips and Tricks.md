# LitR Survival - Tips

## Damage, Health and Healing
- LitR is balanced for default lunar survival damage levels (1 and 1.3), but can be adjusted in the MCM to whatever you want, just make sure you've fought some synths and super mutants before tweaking (because they WILL wreck you). This is an RPG, the early game enemies are supposed to be easy.
- In LitR, the player has a lot more health, and combat should not generally feel super lethal. Horizon players should be familiar with this balance approach. The sweet spot LitR tries to hit is that you can get through most encounters without dying, but you do have to use healing resources. This is specifically to combat the respawn-try again style gameplay vanilla survival has.
- Food can only heal you up to the segment thresholds in your health bar- if you lose an entire segment of health, you need a stimpak, a doctor, or a bed to get it back.

## Ammo    
- Use a melee weapon to conserve ammo on lower level enemies. Ammo is scarce, you will probably need to buy some at some point, so don't waste it. Automatics have their own perk, which grants the chance for extra ammo, it's powerful, but difficult to play with automatics.

## Gun Crafting and Condition
Gun crafting works a little differently in LitR. Weapons fall into two categories - Pipe/Handmade, and Pre-War
- Pipe/Handmade weapons use vanilla-style crafting, mods are crafted from scrap components, and require the Scrapper perk.
- Pre-war weapons use a new crafting mechanic. Instead of being crafted from scratch, you have to scavenge compatible parts from other guns. For example, a scope from a 10mm Pistol can be removed (by crafting a NONE scope in it's place), and then you can put that scope on any other weapon that can have a scope. Doing so normally has no perk requirements.
- Gun Nut and Science are still required for some crafting, however their primary purpose now is to prevent your weapon receiver from degrading. Weapon receivers now randomly degrade, similar to a condition system. There is a very small chance every time you fire the weapon that the receiver will degrade a step e.g Hardened --> Standard. There is no broken state, receivers cannot degrade below Standard.

## Buying & Selling
- Vendors have significantly less caps, and there are no ways to increase the amount of caps they have. If you want caps, then you have to go find them the old fashion way, ask for a quest.

## Food
- Keep your eye out for unique food items at vendors, eating them can unlock a new recipe.
- Crops have a lower harvest rate, don't expect to get something every time. If you want fruit and vegetables to cook with, your best bet is to build up a farm with enough extra production above and beyond what the settlers require that they'll leave some in the workbench for you.
- Cola is great for a quick AP boost

## Power Armor
- Power Armor is VERY powerful. You can basically completely ignore small arms fire, but watch out for heavy weaponry and armor piercing munitions, as they deal extra damage to power armor.
- Different power armors have different niches- the T60 is weaker than the T51 for example, but cheaper to repair.
- Power armor is very difficult to maintain. Repairing it is expensive.
- Power armor is for special occasions. Fusion cores are rare enough that without some way to produce or recycle them yourself, you won't be able to maintain power amor 100% of the time.

## Carry Weight
- Carry weight is restricted in survival.
- Pocketed mods for armor are disabled, if you want carry weight, build the ultralight versions, it effectively does the same thing.
- Backpacks can be found on enemies, or purchased. However, they do give you a stamina penalty.

## Companions in Survival
- Dogmeat doesn't count as a companion for the Lone Wanderer Perk
- Companions heal themselves, and don't need to be stimpacked/repaired when they go down in combat by default.

## Sleeping
- While there are no camping mods included, Sofa Surfing will let you rest on any sofa or armchair.

## Settlements
- Don't use Sanctuary/RedRocket/Abernathy as your home base. 
    * These settlements have the potential performance issues, don't use a SS2 city plan on more than 1 of them.
    * Without fast travel getting to the edge of the map is a pain, pick somewhere more central (e.g., Starlight Drivein)
    * You don't have to start the SS2 quest (build your first recruitment beacon) in sanctuary, Jake will find you at other settlements. I recommend picking somewhere more central.

## True Perks Builds
- If you haven't used True Perks before, don't worry too much about specials at character creation, just put something in, and then after you get the pip boy, spend some time looking at the perks, find a few you want to try, and rebuild your specials around getting them before exiting the vault.
- There is a purchasable perk point respec called "Mindwipe" that will allow you to reset your invested perks, but it won't allow you to respec your specials.
- Because "required" perks have lower requirements, pretty much any build is viable, as long as you have a good mix of offense and defense.
- Endurance 1 is not a good idea
- Special training perks now have a level requirement- you can take the 1st rank at level 7, the 2nd at level 14, etc.
- If there's a specific perk you want though, make sure your starting SPECIALS are high enough to get it. Remember that special training perks now have level requirements.

## Survival Fast Travel
- Local Leader offers fast travel by talking to provisioners at level 2 (to their home or destination settlements).
- When upgraded to level 2, SS2's caravan plots allow fast travel to linked settlements.

## Collectibles
- Magazines and Bobblehead locations are randomized
- There are now 2 full sets of bobbleheads, Vault Boy and Vault Girl.

## Uniques
- Almost every single unique weapon in the game has been replaced with modded weapons, armor or gadgets, including the ones you can buy in shops. Some of them are very powerful end game items, so check them out when you're shopping. You might actually want to buy some of them now.

## Difficulty
The game is significantly more difficult. Super Mutants, Gunners, and Synths will all give you a bad time, and enemies in power armor are to be feared. Avoid quests that pit you against these types of enemies early.

# LitR Survival - Tips

## Hunger & Thirst
- Cola and beer will quench your thirst, they're just as good as water. Cola also restores action points.
- The heavier an item is, the more it will satiate you, with valuable items gaining a bonus

## Ammo    
- Use a melee weapon to conserve ammo on lower level enemies. Ammo is scarce, you will probably need to buy some at some point, so don't waste it.

## Companions in Survival
- Dogmeat doesn't count as a companion for the Lone Wanderer Perk
- Companions heal themselves, and don't need to be stimpacked/repaired when they go down in combat

## Settlements
- Don't use Sanctuary/RedRocket/Abernathy as your home base. 
    * These settlements have performance issues, don't build in more than 1 of them.
    * Without fast travel getting to the edge of the map is a pain, pick somewhere more central (e.g., Starlight Drivein)
    * You don't have to start the SS2 quest (build your first recruitment beacon) in sanctuary, Jake will find you at other settlements. I recommend picking somewhere more central.

## Creative Perks Plus
- If you haven't used CPP before, don't worry too much about specials at character creation, just put something in, and then after you get the pip boy, spend some time looking at the perks, find a few you want to try, and rebuild your specials around getting them.
- Because "required" perks have lower requirements, pretty much any build is viable, as long as you have a good mix of offense and defense. 
- If there's a specific perk you want though, make sure your starting SPECIALS are high enough to get it. Remember that you can only invest in your specials every 7 levels.

## Survival Fast Travel
- Local Leader offers fast travel by talking to provisioners at level 2 (to their home or destination settlements).
- When upgraded to level 2, SS2's caravan plots allow to fast travel to linked settlements.

# Life In The Ruins: A Selection of Lunar Fallout Plus Modlists

A massively overhauled and finely tuned Fallout 4 experience. Designed to rebalance the game so that the challenge comes primarily from scarcity of resources, while staying true to the vanilla asthetic. With options for a more vanilla+ style playthrough, as well as an even more challenging survival experience.

## Modlist Goals
- Difficulty comes from scarcity of resources, not bullet sponges.
- RPG Balance, Scaling, and Progression - brought to you by Lunar Fallout Overhaul.
- Strategic rather than tactical combat - prepare in advance for difficult encounters, instead of respawning until you get it right.
- A vibrant, forested, inhabited, and uncivilised wasteland. Neglected areas should feel fleshed out, but it should still feel lonely.
- New Uniques - almost every single quest reward and vendor unique is now a modded weapon or armor.
- Extra high-quality content with the same style and tone as vanilla (no pointlessly skimpy outfits, no tacti-cool weapons).
- Full controller support (no extra configuration required).
- Smooth performance on mid-range modern gaming hardware.
 
 ### This is not...
- A hardcore, nitty-gritty, track-everything-with-a-spreadsheet survival simulator
- A tactical shooter
- Fallout New Vegas
- A good base-list for building on top of - if you want that try Welcome to Paradise or Fusion
- A modlist that has every mod on the nexus- this is a huge list, but everything in it is hand picked, and carefully integrated to provide a focussed experience, based around an enhanced and expanded vanilla game.

## Profiles
There are 3 profiles available
 * `Settle` : the original profile, which provides a massively overhauled and rebalanced game, including Sim Settlements 2.
 * [Wander](https://github.com/WhiskyTangoFawks/LunarFalloutPlus/blob/main/Wander.md) A less settlement focussed profile, which makes a handful of small changes (compared to the Settle modlist) geared towards the game being less settlement focussed, including the removal of SS2, and the addition of Start Me Up and an Alternate Death mod. This profile has steam deck support.
 * LunarPlus - A more vanilla+ style profile, focussed on letting Lunar Fallout Overhaul shine, without all the additional tweaks I've made to game balance. Does not include True Perks, LBPAC, SS2, or any of my survival mods. This profile also has steam deck support.

### Optional Creation Club Content Compatibility
- [Weapons and Armour Skins](https://github.com/WhiskyTangoFawks/LunarFalloutPlus/blob/main/CreationClubContent.md) Faction Distribution Framework will distribute faction based weapon and armour skins into the world- see the link for more details

## Things you should know...
- Check out the [LitR Survival Tips and Tricks](https://github.com/WhiskyTangoFawks/LunarFalloutPlus/blob/main/LitR%20Tips%20and%20Tricks.md)

### Technical Requirements
- This modlist should be installed on an SSD for performance reasons (the wabbajack download folder can be on an HDD though).
- The main profile requires at least 6gb of Vram.

The modlist is designed for relatively modern, middle range hardware. A high end graphics card is not required, but it does help. There are performance options available, including a steam deck installation guide for the Wander Profile (I don't recommend trying to run SS2 if your hardware is going to limit your performance).

#### If you have less than 6gb of vram or the list otherwise performs badly for you
- Do not try to run the list above 1080p, 1440 in fallout is a performance killer
- See the readme for the wander profile- the list has a selection of performance tweaks designed to get it running on the steam deck.

## Wabbajack Installation
See [How to Wabbajack](https://github.com/WhiskyTangoFawks/LunarFalloutPlus/blob/main/How%20To%20Wabbajack.md) for detailed instructions on using wabbajack to install the modlist
 
*This is a large modlist, with several large downloads, including several large sets of textures. Nexus Premium is __highly__ recommended for the initial download, expect the initial download and installation to take at least an hour with premium.*

### Solving Common Wabbajack Installation Problems
* Set your game language to English if you have the game in another language- the installer does not work in other languages (it needs to find and copy the base game video files)
* Verify you game files in steam, then run the game through steam, then repeat the installation
* Make sure you have at least 300gb free before starting, the modlist needs some extra working space to unpack and repack the archives
* If installation fails, and the log has "data error cyclic redundancy check", then you're file paths are too long, try something shorter like "C:\modlists\LitR"
* Unable to download all mods - long out and then back in to the nexus in the wabbajack settings
  
## Additional Setup (post wabbajack installation)
### Customisation
1. Creation Club: If you want to use the creation club paint job support, copy the [required Creation Club paint jobs](https://github.com/WhiskyTangoFawks/LunarFalloutPlus/blob/main/CreationClubContent.md) files from your `fallout4/data directory` into the `[NODELETE][CC] CreationClub Paint Jobs` mod folder, and enable the 5 [CC] tagged mods. Otherwise, you can skip this step.
2. (Recommended) Download and install into the `[NODELETE] Cross Skin Packs` (found in the difficulty and customization section),  the following skin packs from https://gumroad.com/niero. They're available for free (use the discount code which can be found on the checkout page), but a donation is suggested. The man makes some fantastic mods, and you can probably afford to buy him a coffee. The links for the 2k version are provided below, however the 4k are also available.
    * [Break Action Laser Skin Pack](https://niero.gumroad.com/l/fhdhdh)
    * [Cross Cryolance](https://niero.gumroad.com/l/mQKCt)
3. The `Difficulty and Customisation` section in Mod Organizer - for people who want to tweak thing a little.
    * `Lucky 7 - Hardcore Start`: You get 7 points to spend at start instead of the regular 24, and get an extra perk point every 7 levels. For players who want a real challenge.
    * `Fast Start - Skip Pre-War Sanctuary` Optional mod that allows you to skip the pre-war prologue
    * `120FPS No VSYNC` : If you run a high refresh rate monitor with GSync/FreeSync, this will disable vsync, and cap the framerate at 120.
    * `Nvidia Reflex Support` and `Nvidia Weapon Debris Crash Fix` - users with nvidia graphics cards should enable these, users with AMD graphics cards can ignore them.
4. Field of View (FOV)
    It is recommended to leave the FoV vanilla. If you have to change it, use BethINI or edit the ini manually. The setting can be found under Details. Setting the FoV higher than 90 has been known to cause weird visual issues with armor mods in the list. Do not use the game console to change the FOV, it will not work.

### Game INI Settings with BethINI
How to Setup your own ini files with Bethini
1. Close Mod Organizer, and open BethINI from the `Tools` folder inside your LitR installation
2. `Setup` tab 
    * Check that the game path is pointing to the `Stock Game Folder`, and not your steam installation
    * Check that the mod organizer path is pointing to the correct instance of MO2 for Life in the Ruins.
    * Check that your game settings path is set to `my documents/my games/fallout 4`
3. `Basic` Tab
    * Choose a profile at least one step lower than you would use for vanilla fallout. For most users with less than a 3090 I recommend medium or high, LitR is significantly heavier than vanilla fallout. (The shorter draw distances on medium make A Forest much easier to run, and A Forest makes it so you can't see stuff way in the distance anyway)
    * For most users, 1920x1080 resolution is recommended.
    * Enable `VSync` unless you're using Gsync/FreeSync (the `High FPS Physics Fix` mod controls VSync and this settings should be ignored, but having it match here doesn't hurt)
    * On the custom tab, select `general` in the section drop down, and `iNumHWThreads` in the settings drop down. Set this to the number of cores your CPU has, doubling that number if it has hyperthreading. For more information on this setting, see https://stepmodifications.org/wiki/Guide:Skyrim_INI/General#iNumHWThreads
    

#### Video Memory And ENBoost

* [Introduction to ENBoost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4cz-lFXDo8)
* [How to find your optimal value with ENBoost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSz84F1kgkM)
    - In the ENBoost section, are three presets to enable ENBoost 8k, 12k, and 16k, with the required files editted and ready to use, all you have to do is enable one of them. See the above videos for help choosing what value works best for you.
        * Higher values might work for users with a lot of vram, but are unnessary, for most users will actually reduce performance and stability. Even with high res textures, FO4 doesn't require that much memory.
    
ENBoost is a feature of ENB that allows your FO4 to extend your system's VRAM with your regular RAM. It's not as fast, but it's better than nothing. AMD users with resizable BAR enabled should see even better performance improvements with this setting, and it's recommended to try it out. However this is a HIGHLY system specific setting. What works great for a user with a 3090, will crash for a user with less, which is why it's not turned on for you by default.

If you have issues with textures not loading, stuttering, or the brown face bug, it is recommended to try this.

#### Nvidia/AMD Control Center

Settings here are going to be very system and driver specific, but some general things to be aware of
* VSync settings MUST be set to application controlled 
* Disable any framerate caps or limits
* Make sure your drivers are up to date.
* If you have FreeSync/Gsync enabled and an adaptive sync capable monitor, then you need either enable the 120 FPS NoVsync option in the customization section, or to make your own version of the HighFPSPhysicsFix configuration ini, to disable vsync and set the FPS cap to your desired value (however, due to the havok engine limitations, 60 or 120 is still recommended).

### In Game Setup
0. Start a new survival game (recommended, but not required)
1. Mod Configuration Menu - Recommended Settings
    * MCM Manager: Load the LitR Default settings
    * Enable Immersive Hud if you want to use it
2. Once you're out of the vault, use the Beantown Interiors Settings holotape to enable Hardcore Clutter, and Disable The Mad Bomber's Workshop and Colletibles crafting (these are recommended settings, but aren't required)

## Updating the Modlist
To Update the modlist, just rerun the wabbajack installer with the updated download from the wabbajack gallery (or prerelease from my patreon).
You do not need to rerun Bethini, as with Life in the Ruins the the game settings are stored in their default location, not inside the list.
You may need to reapply any MCM settings that you changed. If you're making extensive MCM changes, it is recommended to export these and back them up outside your LitR install before updating.

## Known Issues
- Performance Issues: Infinite Loading Screens, Micro Stuttering, Textures not loading, or the Brown Face bug: 
    1. Stop other processes to free up RAM, browser windows are especially a problem here
    2. Try setting the resolution to 1920x1080 if you're running above that
    3. Make sure you've set iNumHWThreads, as specified in the Bethini section of this readme.
- SS2 script failures on new game are the result of going through the opening sequence too quickly. After you finish character creation, wait for 30 seconds or so before exiting the bathroom.
- Crashing
    - Medal.TV is incompatible with ENB, disable one or the other.


## Crashlog Scanner

The list includes the [Buffout 4 Crashlog Auto Scanner](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/56255), found inside the tools folder. To use simply copy paste the crashlog from your `my documents/my games/fallout 4/f4se`, into the `tools/Scan Crash Logs Script` folder inside your LitR installation, and run the crashlog scanner from the dropdown in MO2. See the readme.md in the same folder for information on how to interpret the results.
- Disable the `FRS` option in the scanner
- The script will throw a lot of warnings in the `CHECKING FOR MODS THAT CAN CAUSE FREQUENT CRASHES...`. These can all be safely ignored, I have already dealt with all of them. You do not need to make any modifications to the mod list to deal with CTDs- these are almost always either random instability (which is expected in heavily modded FO4, but should be minimal), mis-configurations on the user end, or modifications that the user has made to the list.

## FAQ

Q: Where are all the bobbleheads and magazines?
A: [Random Valuables Redux](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/60097)

Q: Where are all the modded weapons
A: Most of the modded weapons and armor in the list are replacers for vanilla Uniques, check the unique replacer sections in MO2 if you want to check for an exact mod

Q: Why is my loading time so long
A: Probably because you didn't enable one of the ENBoost Presets

Q: What's up with See Thru Scopes?
A: It's included as a resource for one of the mod added weapons, but not enabled. It was removed from the list when I started expanding the number of weapons - there are just too many that don't support it, and it was causing confusion. If you want to try and re-enable it, ask for help in the modified litr channel in the discord.

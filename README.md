## Bem Vindo Ao Apocalipse

## Modlist Goals
- RPG Balance, Scaling, and Progression - brought to you by Lunar Fallout Overhaul
- Survival Mechanics, with non-survival damage levels and balance (uses a custom mod to change damage modifier back to normal without disabling survival mechanics)
- A vibrant, forested, inhabited, but still uncivilised wasteland. Neglected areas should feel fleshed out, but still match the vanilla aesthetic
- Increased variety in Creatures, Weapons and Armors by mods that add variety to existing content (attachments and alt skins), rather than mods that add a ton of new unbalanced items and monsters
- Extra high-quality content with the same style and tone as vanilla (no pointlessly skimpy outfits, no tacti-cool weapons)
- Full controller support (no extra configuration required)
- Smooth performance on mid-range gaming hardware
 
 ### This is not...
- a hardcore, nitty-gritty survival simulator - if you want that go play a Horizon based list.
- a twitch shooter - if you want that, go play one of the Better Locational Damage based lists
- Fallout New Vegas - if you want that, go play Fallout New Vegas
- an "everything but the kitchen sink" list with every mod out there - if you want that, go play Magnum Opus or MOFAM
- a super-difficult make-the-game-impossible list for people who've played FO4 100x and know it like the back of their hand
- a good base-list for building on top of - if you want that try Welcome to Paradise

## Things you should know...
- Perks have increasing SPECIAL requirements, and specials can be trained past 10.
- Power armour is more powerful, but rare, and fusion cores are harder to come by and won't always be full. The more damaged your power armor is, the less it will protect you, so keep an eye on it's condition in the HUD.
- Shoot/Kick/Explode locks open, and bypass hacking. Read the nexus page for [LockyBastard](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/13380) and [Auto-Hack](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/45219) for more details.
- Survival fast travel is available early game by taking the Local Leader Perk and building a provisioner network, or later on by building the SS2 Caravan plot. If you want an easier fast travel, you can enable the optional Explorer perk unlock for it, or just enable it fully via unlimited survival.
- You don't need to stimpack your companions after combat, the survival requirement to use a stimpack to get them up is disabled.
- The [SS2 Triangle of Death](https://simsettlements.com/site/index.php?threads/understanding-ctds-in-the-triangle-of-death-sanctuary-abernathy-farm-and-red-rocket.6964/) is still a problem, and always will be. Do not heavily develop more than one of those three settlements.
- This modlist uses Dynamic Performance Tuner to adjust shadow draw distance to try and keep a stable framerate. If shadow pop-in annoys you more than framerate drops, it can be disabled by removing "dxgi.dll" in the Stock Game Folder. If you have a strong graphics card and are playing at greater than 60FPS, you may gain minor quality benefits by upping the target FPS in dynaperf.ini in the stock game folder to whatever your framerate cap is, or adjusting min/max shadow distance.

### Technical Requirements
- The modlist is designed for relatively modern, middle range hardware. A high end graphics card is not required, but it does help (I tested this list on a Radeon 580 with medium settings, currently playing with a 6600xt on high settings, and FPS is consistently capped above 60 outside of Diamond City and Boston Commons, where it does drop for me). If you have less than 6gb of vram, I would recommend replacing the texture BSAs in the stock folder with the vanilla ones, or with the PhyOP textures. For users who need more performance, I also suggest using BethINI to tweak the grass diversity settings. You can also try disabling the ENB (press * to show FPS, then press shift + F12 to disable ENB processing to see if it makes a difference). The list includes Dynamic Performance Tuner, which will automatically try and adjust your shadow draw distance to compensate for FPS drops.
 
## Wabbajack Installation
See [How to Wabbajack](https://github.com/WhiskyTangoFawks/LunarFalloutPlus/blob/main/How%20To%20Wabbajack.md) for detailed instructions on using wabbajack to install the modlist
 
*This is a large modlist, with several large downloads, including several large sets of textures that require optimising and repacking. Nexus Premium is __highly__ recommended for the initial download, expect the initial download and installation to take at least an hour.*

- HD DLC is NOT required, however because this modlist uses a stock game folder, rather than your game folder in steam, if you do have the HD DLC installed Life in the Ruins will ignore it.
  
## Additional Setup (post wabbajack installation)
1. Pick your Profile: "Life in the Ruins", or "Life in the Ruins - CreationClubPaints" if you have the required set of creation club paint jobs
    -  Creation Club Profile - Copy the creation club files from your `fallout4/data directory` into the `[NODELETE] CreationClub Paint Jobs` mod folder
2. (Optional) Download and install into the mod `[NODELETE] Cross Skin Packs` the Strigidae and Brotherhood Recon Expeditionary Suit skin packs from https://gumroad.com/niero. They're available for free (use the discount code), but a donation is suggested. The man makes some fantastic mods, and you can probably afford to buy him a coffee.
3. The `Difficulty and Customisation` section in Mod Organizer - for people who want to tweak thing a little.
    * `[NODELETE] Cross Skin Packs` : the downloaded cross skins go here
    * `QoL Tweaks` : Minor quality of life tweaks, disable any you don't want
    * `Vanilla Hud - No Sneak Indicator` : Removes the sneak indicator from the HUD
    * `More Dangerous Deathclaws` : makes deathclaws faster at lower health
    * `SMR Balance Options` : Reduces Super Mutant resistances, default is -30-20, disable for harder supermutants
    * `LFO Hardcore Patch` : see https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/articles/3431/ for details. I just makes loot a bit rarer. Recommended.
    * `Survival difficulty`: The default is `Difficulty-Normal`. If you want an easier or harder damage levels, choose one of the other optional files
    * `Optional - Explorer Perk Survival Fast Travel`: An alternate version of the explorer perk that allows limited fast travel.
    * `90FPS No VSYNC` : If you run a high refresh rate monitor, this will disable vsync, and cap the framerate at 90. Edit the file for alternate values. Dynamic Performance may require tweaking to compensate.
    * `SKK Fast Start new game` : enable this to skip the intro sequence on a new game
 4. By default the modlist runs at 1920x1080, if your system isnt running at that resolution, you either need to swap from windowed to full screen, or change the resolution to match your system. The list uses profile specific inis, so use the MO2 ini editor to make sure you get the right one (Puzzle icones in mo2 -> INI editor)

### In Game Setup
0. Start a new survival game (recommended, but not required)
1. Mod Configuration Menu - Recommended Optional Setting
    - Survival Configuration Menu (recommended)
        * turn ON savegame -> timed save
    - Sim Settlements 2 (optional)
        * Gameplay -> Resource Complexity to Scrap Categories (this will set SS2 to use a simplified scrap system of 4 scrap types, instead of requiring specific components, but instead of using items in your workbench, you will need to donate material at the city planner desk for your citizens to use them)
    - Immersive HUD
        * I personally don't use it, but have included it in the list for people who want it.
 
3. (Optional) Craft a companion whistle at a chem lab bench, this will teleport any active companion to you, useful when you accidentally tell them to stay and can't find them, or they're screwing with NPC pathing during a quest
4. (Optional) Craft the companion tracker holotape at the chem lab bench. This allows you to track inactive companions, for cases where you can't remember which settlement you sent them to. 


## Known Issues
- Cait is missing her shotgun after being recruited. This is a bug with Combat Zone Restored, after recruiting her you can run the following console command
`00079305.additem 0005df30 1`
- Sim Settlements quest locations might have awkward trees from A Forest. Please report them, so that I can have the lumberjack clear them out.
- Beastmaster welcome quest starts after reloading the game after taking the perk, instead of immediately when you take the perk
- Navmesh conflicts between Tales From the Commonwealth, Diamond City Outskirts, and SKK Red Rockets. This won't introduce any instability, but NPCs may have trouble pathing in rare cases.
- Preston and Piper's default outfits both can cause them to go invisible, I think its a vanilla bug, I am still trying to discover the exact cause
 
## Notable Missing Mods
- XDI : I don't personally use it or like it. An upcoming version of the list will likely include Dialogue Sneak Peak as a comprimise.
- Scrap Mods : I personally don't use them, and am not going to add something to the list I haven't test. I recommend SS2's city plans if you want more automation for settlement development.
- VAFS: I play the game on my couch, with an xbox controller, using VATS pretty much exclusively. If you want slow time aiming, take the sniper perk (which has a weak slow time effect), and stockpile JET.
- AWKCR - Yes, this is an AWKCR-free modlist. Gunmetal Faction Distribution does have an ArmorKeywords dummy plugin it uses for some keywords, but it does not include any of the bloat or unexpected features of the full AWKCR mod.
- Beantown Interiors - It's a compatibility nightmare, both because it breaks precombines, and because it destroys the loot balance of the list
- CBBE- I find barbie doll proportions un-immersive. Women don't look like that in real life.
- Thuggysmurf (Depravity, Outcasts and Remnants, etc)- The quality of the work on these mods is incredible, but they are massively let down by the writing and choice to include adolescent jokes. I personally find a lot of it cringeworthy. A mod that adds a dildo as a weapon and has a bunch of female NPCs in skimpy sexy corsets isn't one I want in my load order, and I'm not comfortable recommending it to people.
- 100s of Weapons and Armour mods - this list has a relatively conservative approach to weapons and armour, both due to personal choice and the challenge of balancing for Lunar Fallout. In game diversity is provided through Gunmetal Weapons and Armour Skins. As stated at the top, this isn't a kitchen sink list.
- Mods that were removed in the Great Nexus Purge and are no longer available : Utility Belt, Better Cooking Stations (v1), MsRae's Commonwealth Interiors, Swinging Animated Meatbags. All of these are compatible, and don't need patching. Feel free to add them if you have them.
- Previsibine Repair Pack- this modlist uses BostonFPSFix for now. It's not perfect (a couple of missing material swaps), but it is reliable. Because PRP touches every single cell in the game (including cells that didn't need fixing) it's a huge undertaking, still under development, and a compatibility headache.
 
## Unsupported Activities - Adding your own mods
If you want to add stuff to the list, you do so at your own risk. You're on your own, but if you're really nice about it we'll offer advice in the discord.  If you choose to do so, there are a couple things to know...
0. The correct way (IMHO) to add stuff to an existing modlist, is to use the `[NODELETE]` tag, this will cause wabbajack to ignore it. New mods should be added at the END of the modlist, the whole point of adding a mod is to override the existing changes in the list, so at the end is *probably* where you want it. I recommend also adding a tag to order the mods you add alphabetically in the order you want, so that when you update the base list the folders will be added to the end, in the order you want them, and you just have to re-enable them, and then rerun the sorter patch. So, when you add a new mod, it will look like this in the left hand pane `[NODELETE] 01 Default Mod Name`. This allows you to apply critical updates from the main list, while keeping it relatively easy to maintain your additions. The `[NODELETE]` tag applies to any folder, including profiles. So if you want to do something more complex with load order, you can copy the existing profile, rename it and include the `[NODELETE]` tag at the start, and when the installer runs when you update it will leave your custom profile untouched.
2. Lunar Fallout Overhaul has a specific balance, adding new weapons, armors, monsters, or items is NOT RECOMMENDED. It probably won't break it, but it will screw with the balance. If you want to patch it in, information on how the mod works and it's balance can be found on Moonracer's Lunar Fallout Overhaul mod page.
3. This modlist has a staggering amount of custom patching, and even completely custom mods, all with the vision of integrating everything together into a cohesive whole. The answer to "does this mod conflict with the Life in the Ruins" is ALWAYS going to be yes, there are very few things that haven't been touched, tweaked, or reworked. If you don't know how to do conflict resolution in xedit, turn back now.
4. The mod uses M8r98a4f2's Complex Item Sorte v1.9, with 4estGimps Item Sorter Enhancements. The sorting plugin can be regenerated by running the script in xEdit (which is shipped with the modlist). When you run the script, it will ask you to activate the AWKCR addon- *DO NOT DO SO*. The AWKCR plugin in this list is NOT the normal AWKCR, and does not require special patching by the sorter.
5. As stated above, the AWKCR plugin in this list is NOT the normal AWKCR. AWKCR Dependent mods will not work with it.
6. This modlist includes custom precombines for the Downtown Boston, and Diamond City areas. If you break them, it will destroy performance.
7. This list is near the BSA limit, if you add mods and experience CTDs, that is a likely cause.

# 2.2.0-prelease Stop complaining that LitR doesn't have enough Weapons Part II : Reign of the Uniques

    This is a pateron pre-release of 2.2.0, it includes all the unique replacements, however they aren't all patched for LFO balance yet.
    A new game is recommended, due to the scale of the changes.

    With the addition of the Cryolance, and the Archimedes II, I suggest grabbing Neiro's Skinpacks for them from Gumroad

# 2.1.0 Someone Tell Luxor to Stop Updating...

Update includes Fourville, and some new weapons, as well as a bunch of other new stuff and minor content.

This update includes yet another "final" update to Fallout 4 HD Overhaul, which means another 50gb of downloads. For those of you without nexus premium, I'm sorry.

Due to changes around Uniques, and the removal of Eli's Armor Compendium, and some general cleanup of levelled lists, a new game is recommended.

If you want to update an existing save, find an interior cell, set the game to a non-survival setting, wait 10 days, and set the game back to survival. This should reset all partially cleared cells. Due to the removal of Eli's Armor Compendium, you might still see some naked NPCs (settlers, a few companions), just give them some clothes.

A new game is required for changes to the unique weapons to take effect. In an existing game, If you want, you can disable Unique Uniques Vanilla Legendaries Mod (if you don't existing unique weapons mods will lose their special abilities, but the weapons won't gain the legendary attachments, nothing will break, but you might be sad).

# 2.0.1.1 Hotfix

This is a hotfix try and address the recuring infinite loading screen issue some users have been having. I believe the root cause was related to vsync settings and windowed mode for users, possibly interacting with GSync/FreeSync settings. It also includes a hotfix for Workshop Framework that was preventing some SS2 quests from progressing.

This also includes a swap to using the standard system game INI files, instead of profile ones. It's caused confusion in the past, and makes it harder to optimise your settings and update the list, and may have contributed to the ILS issues. See the (readme)[https://github.com/WhiskyTangoFawks/LunarFalloutPlus#readme] for settings recommendations.

# 2.0.0 Stop complaining this list needs more weapons
This update is a major overhaul of weapons, Power Armor, and their distribution. A new game is strongly recommended (due to the scale of the changes to weapon and power armor distribution, and the removal of VUWR-R).

To update an existing game (Not recommended, but it is possible possible) make a clean save (go into an interior cell, update, set game to non-survival, wait 3 days, turn the game back to survival). This should reset all cells, and allow you to find the new weapons in the world. Due to the removal of VUWR, and the addition of Unique Uniques, unique weapons will be missing their mods, however unique uniques should detect this, and add the missing mods.

Recommended - Go download the Cross Break Action Laser Skins from [Neiro's Gumroad](https://niero.gumroad.com/l/fhdhdh)

Warning - This update includes the final update from the Fallout 4 HD Overhaul mod, which means about 40gb of downloads are required.

This update adds a LOT of new BSAs. If you find yourself CTDing when starting or loading a game, it's because you've hit the limit, and need to repack and combine some of them to get beneath the limit. The creation club content is particularly problematic here, because of how many archives it has. I'll be experimenting with repacking the texture mods into the main game archives, however that will require more time and testing before it's ready.

# 1.1.3 
This update is safe safe if you haven't started the Nuka-World Quest or visited Nuka-World. If you have, I recommend either not updating, or manually rolling back Nuka-World Plus to version 0.995.

This update removes the M2019, and the 10mm SMG. Make sure to unequip any you are carrying before updating. Both guns are below the quality of what I'd like in the list, and swapping to the split LFO patch game me the chance to remove these. I won't be replacing them directly, but have plans for a few more weapons additions.

This update includes changes to aid items and disease curing. Each disease is now cured by one chem/drug, antibiotics now only cures infection.

# 1.0.3 - Provisioners and Power Armor
This update brings big changes to Survival Fast Travel, and to power armor.
_This update is save-safe as long as you are not using a city plan from Rise of the Commonwealth, if you are it is recommended to switch to a different plan before updating, as they have been removed due to being buggy._

- Survival fast travel has been removed from the explorer perk, and added to the Local Leader perk (the 2nd rank now allows you to fast travel by talking with your provisioners). The fast travel version of the explorer perk is still available in the optional section, if you've already taken explorer 2, 3 or 4 I recommend enabling.
- Power Armor health now matters, damaged power armor will protect you significantly less than power armor in full repair, keep an eye on it's condition with the new stats widget.
- If you want to randomize the bobblehead locations in your existing save, go stand on the entrance to Vault 111.
- Stats for various clothing with railroad weave have been changed, so they have lower stats, but spawn with an undercoat. Unfortunatly, this means if you already have them, you will just get the lower stats.

# 1.0.3 - Provisioners and Power Armor
This update brings big changes to Survival Fast Travel, and to power armor.
_This update is save-safe as long as you are not using a city plan from Rise of the Commonwealth, if you are it is recommended to switch to a different plan before updating, as they have been removed due to being buggy._

- Survival fast travel has been removed from the explorer perk, and added to the Local Leader perk (the 2nd rank now allows you to fast travel by talking with your provisioners). The fast travel version of the explorer perk is still available in the optional section, if you've already taken explorer 2, 3 or 4 I recommend enabling.
- Power Armor health now matters, damaged power armor will protect you significantly less than power armor in full repair, keep an eye on it's condition with the new stats widget.
- If you want to randomize the bobblehead locations in your existing save, go stand on the entrance to Vault 111.
- Stats for various clothing with railroad weave have been changed, so they have lower stats, but spawn with an undercoat. Unfortunatly, this means if you already have them, you will just get the lower stats.

- Added
    * GKX Random Valuable Replacer (Custom version that only does bobbleheads)
    * Cambridge Ghouls Horde
    * Scrappable power armor pieces
